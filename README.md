# Calculator

Basic calculator that can multiply/divide/add/subtract, support decimals, and has keypad functionality. 

## Key Takeaways/Challenges

Operator function 
- The biggest challenge was figuring out how to chain together operations. To do that, I decided to push the user input into an array each time the operator button was clicked.

Booleans 
- Using functions with booleans to check if certain conditions were met (i.e. if decimal button had already been pressed).

DOM Manipulation 
- Using JS HTML DOM methods to add event listeners and register clicks, record the event, and update the HTML text. 

Objects 
- Storing data in objects, and then later accessing & making use of this data through loops and object methods. 

## Areas for Improvement

- I wish I had done more planning in pseudocode before actually beginning to code.
- I will continue working to make my code more efficient and easier to read. Currently there are too many functions nested within one another.
